        <h2>Other ideas</h2>
        <h3>Full courses</h3>
        <p>
          There could also be continuous series of lectures about one subject -
          i.e. a full course. For example, course of Theory of Computation.
          Taught probably just by students and not free (because otherwise no
          one would take it seriously). But for try-out it could be integrated
          to the standard meet-ups.
        </p>
        <h3>Lecture movie nights</h3>
        <p>
          Organize MIT or other lecture movie nights - gather together and just
          watch non stop Quantum Physics lectures or some other stuff.
        </p>
        <h3>Chemistry and electronics lab</h3>
        <p>
          It would be great to have a very minimalistic chemistry lab to do some
          basic experiments for educational purposes. Ant it would be also nice
          to have electronics lab - all in one place: components, soldering,
          etc.
        </p>
        <h3>Book of Everything</h3>
        <h4>Geometry textbook for school</h4>
        <p>
          A textbook only about geometry at roughly highschool level. For
          Lithuanian schools. But probably would be great idea to write it also
          in English. And, ofc, have some digital version of it for
          visualizations, automations etc. The content would begin with very
          strict axioms and everything would be very rigorous. Also would
          include a geometry tikz tool for drawing geometric figures. Maybe also
          using Coq Proof Assistant.
        </p>
        <h4>Other axiomatic systems</h4>
        <p>
          Strictly formalize other axiomatic systems, somtehing like Principia
          Matematica. Or just analyze more the Principia Matematica and then
          rewrite everything in humanly comprehensible language.
        </p>
        <h4>Philosophy</h4>
        <p>
          The final product would be a philosophical system that would describe
          how the whole world works, very similar to Bertrand Russell
          philosophy, but more formalized. In other words - the whole book would
          be about matematical logic and mathematical philosophy implementation
          in general philosophy and everyday life.
